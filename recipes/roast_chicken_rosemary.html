        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This rosemary roasted chicken is inspired by my time in Italy. When I was in Vicenza at a downtown open-air market, I smelled scrumptious roast chicken from a stand. So, I bought one and saw what they stuffed in the cavity to make it taste so good. I prepare turkey this way, too.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, rinsed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 small onion, quartered</li>
            <li>&frac14 cup chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken all over with salt and pepper, including cavity. Stuff cavity with onion and rosemary. Place chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish or roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
